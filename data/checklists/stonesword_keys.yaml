description: "Stonesword Keys are consumable key items that open Imp Statue Seals, which typically guard loot, dungeons, or optional paths. A maximum of 80 Stonesword Keys can be found in the game, plus 2 if chosen as a Keepsake. However, only 46 are required to open every Imp Statue Seal. Imp Statues each require either 1 or 2 keys, and the only way to tell the difference is by visual examination: most Imp Statues already have one key in them when you find them, meaning you only need one more."
